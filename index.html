        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Satheesh Bhukya</strong>, an IIT Dhanbad graduate with a Master’s degree in 
            <strong>Mathematics and Computing</strong>. I am passionate about building scalable AI systems 
            that move from research to real-world deployment.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my 6-month internship at <strong>Novus Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz</strong> (ADAS Team), 
            I built a real-time <strong>Driver Identification System</strong> and benchmarked and optimized 
            <strong>Depth Estimation models (Depth Anything series)</strong>. I improved inference performance 
            by converting models to ONNX format for efficient deployment, supporting integration into a 
            Forward Collision Warning (FCW) pipeline.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have hands-on experience developing end-to-end ML pipelines — from model training 
            and evaluation to optimization and production deployment using Python, PyTorch, 
            FastAPI, vector databases, and ONNX.
        </p>

        <p>
            My interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Large Language Models (LLMs), 
            Generative AI, and building real-time RAG-based systems.
        </p>
