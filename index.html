        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m <strong>Satheesh Bhukya</strong>, an IIT Dhanbad graduate with a Master’s degree in 
            <strong>Mathematics and Computing</strong>. I have hands-on experience building, evaluating, 
            and optimizing machine learning models for real-world and production applications.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have worked on end-to-end ML pipelines — from data collection and feature engineering 
            to model benchmarking, performance optimization, and deployment. My work spans 
            Computer Vision and Language Models, including Generative AI and RAG-based systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my 6-month internship at <strong>Novus Hi-Tech Robotic Systemz</strong> (ADAS Team), 
            I developed a real-time <strong>Driver Identification System</strong> and benchmarked 
            <strong>Depth Estimation models (Depth Anything series)</strong>. I optimized inference 
            performance by converting models to ONNX format, enabling efficient deployment within a 
            Forward Collision Warning (FCW) pipeline.
        </p>

        <p>
            My interests include Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Large Language Models (LLMs), 
            Generative AI, and building real-time RAG-based systems.
